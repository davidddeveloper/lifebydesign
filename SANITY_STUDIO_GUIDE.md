## Workflow

### Publishing Content

1. **Create** - Fill out your document with all required information
2. **Preview** - Click "Preview Draft" to see how it looks on the website
3. **Review** - Share the preview link with team members for feedback
4. **Publish** - Toggle the "Published" switch to make it live
5. **View Live** - Click "View Live" to see the published version on your site

### Draft/Publish Workflow

Each document has a **Published toggle** that controls visibility:

- **OFF (Draft)** - Only visible in the preview URL, not on the live site
- **ON (Published)** - Visible on your live website

This allows you to draft content without affecting your live site.

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Always use Preview** - Before publishing, click "Preview Draft" to see exactly how your content will look
2. **Test links** - Share preview links with your team before publishing
3. **Use featured images** - They appear on blog listings and social media cards
4. **Fill in descriptions** - These appear in search results and social sharing
5. **Slugs are auto-generated** - Based on your title, but you can customize them
6. **Categories matter** - Help organize content and improve SEO

## Preview URLs

When you click "Preview Draft", you get a unique URL like:
\`\`\`
https://lifebydesign.com/api/preview?slug=my-article&type=blog&token=abc123...
\`\`\`

This link:
- Is private and secure
- Works for 24 hours
- Can be shared with anyone
- Shows draft content even before publishing

## Troubleshooting

**"View Live" button is grayed out**
- Solution: Your document must be published first. Click the "Published" toggle to turn it on.

**Preview URL not working**
- Solution: Make sure the document has a slug and is a blog post, page, job, product, or partner document type.

**Changes not appearing**
- Solution: Click "Preview Draft" to refresh the preview after making changes.
